            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>
              To support young athletes living in Chicago's northside
              neighborhoods, who have an interest in earning and playing soccer,
              with opportunities to learn and practice skills related to the
              game of soccer, specifically those skills around team cooperation
              and good sportsmanship.

            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>
              The Northside Youth Soccer League aspires to develop strong,
              well-rounded, and mindful athletes through the buildin of
              character, self-discipline, and leadership.

            <h3>General information</h3>
            <p>
              The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to
              provide athletes residing in Chicago's northside neighborhoods an
              environment in which to play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you
              must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago
              northside neighborhood. NYSL is ran by a small full-time staff,
              and relies on the generous volunteer time of partents and previous
              league members.
